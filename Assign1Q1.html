			The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
			a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
			such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
			documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
			included cues for its appearance.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
			images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides
			a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
			lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

		The W3C recommends several conventions to ensure an easy migration between HTML and
		XHTML (see HTML Compatibility Guidelines). The following steps can be applied to XHTML 1.0 documents only:
